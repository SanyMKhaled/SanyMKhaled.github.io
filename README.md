<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>In today’s world, Food has become more than just a necessity. The restaurant business has become more challenging, and competitive day by day.  Designing a restaurant business means committing responsibilities such as providing excellent service, quality food, and a fantastic atmosphere, taking a lot of time and money. We often see their business fall apart after doing all this because people usually don’t know about it. There is nothing where people can know anything about the restaurant. </p>
  <p> My goal is to make a web application where people can know more about the restaurant. From anywhere, they can check the details about the restaurant, what service they provide, where the restaurant is located, and many more. People can also give reviews on food items. </p>
<p> Treatex is a web application built with the latest technologies for the potential customers of the restaurant.
</p>
<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A customers can view items of the restaurant </li>
<li>A customer can check the prices of the food items</li>
<li>A video walkthrough to the restaurant to check decoration and enviornment</li>
<li>Contact form to register and give feedback about food</li>
<li>Offer section &ndash; latest exclusive offers will be shown here</li>
<li>Real- time chat with Treatex</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>We decided to go with latest technologies for developing this application in order to give users a better experience.</p>
<p><em>Frontend and Backend</em></p>
<p>For the UI we will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React and redux. This enables cross platform development which allows the web app to be compatible with both PC and mobile platforms. It also gives a more premium user interface and smoother experience.</p>
<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>I will be using JSON server ans Rest Api which provides high performance, availability and automatic scaling.</p>
<p>I will integrate a real-time chatting system using React hooks and socket.io </p>
<p>To keep up with the modern forms of technology we would be using additional technologies to ensure complete user satisfaction. </p>
